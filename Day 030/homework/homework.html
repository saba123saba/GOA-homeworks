        <p>Arguably the most famous date in English history, most people can link the year of 1066 
        with the Battle of Hastings. Whether or not King Harold really was killed by an arrow in the eye, 
        England was transformed by the events on the battlefield in East Sussex that day. William's victory 
        at Hastings earned him the nickname 'the Conqueror' - he was crowned by Christmas and Norman 
        influence swept across the country. <button>More</button></p><br><br>
