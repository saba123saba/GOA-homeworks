        The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a landmark and favored tourist spot for one main reason: it leans over 4 degrees to the side.
        You might think that it moved over time, but it's actually been tilted from the beginning, when the third floor was originally a
        dded. No one could figure out why it was doing that, so they just let it be. Scientists did eventually determine that the reason
        that the Tower leans is because it is built on soft clay.
