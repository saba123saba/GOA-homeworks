        <i>The nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by 
            the King Bagrat III of Georgia in the early 11th century, arising from several predecessor states of the ancient kingdoms 
            of Colchis and Iberia. The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries under King David IV the Builder 
            and Queen Tamar the Great, and fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a brief reunion under George V the Brilliant 
            to the Timurid Empire. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the 
            Early Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian domination until Georgia was finally 
            annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief period of independence as Democratic Republic of Georgia, 
            the country soon ended up being a Soviet Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The current republic of Georgia
            has been independent since 1991.</i>

        <p class="paragrafi">Diauehi, a tribal union of early-Georgians, first appear in written history in the 12th century BC.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] 
            Archaeological finds and references in ancient sources reveal elements of early political and state formations characterized by 
            advanced metallurgy and goldsmith techniques that date back to the 7th century BC and beyond.[15] Between 2100 and 750 BC, the 
            area survived the invasions by the Hittites, Urartians, Medes, Proto-Persians and Cimmerians. During the same period, the ethnic 
            unity of Proto-Kartvelians broke up into several branches, among them Svans, Zans/Chans, and East-Kartvelians. That finally led to
            the formation of modern Kartvelian languages: Georgian (originating from East Kartvelian vernaculars), Svan, Megrelian and Laz
            (the latter two originating from Zan dialects). By that time Svans were dominant in modern Svaneti and Abkhazia, Zans inhabited
            the modern Georgian province of Samegrelo, while East-Kartvelians formed the majority in modern eastern Georgia. As a result of 
            cultural and geographic delimitation, two core areas of future Georgian culture and statehood formed in western and eastern
            Georgia by the end of the 8th century BC. The first two Georgian states emerged in the west known as the Kingdom of Colchis 
            and in the east the Kingdom of Iberia.</p>
